2025-06-28 17:55:41,806 - INITIAL TASK: Please help me to add update product command for sample code
2025-06-28 17:55:45,115 - THOUGHT: I need to add an 'update product' command. First, I'll explore the codebase to understand the existing structure, especially how commands are defined and handled, and how products are managed. I'll start by listing the files in the current directory.
