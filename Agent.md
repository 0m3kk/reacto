### **Summary of the AI Coding Agent's Features**

This is a powerful, interactive, and safe AI assistant designed for complex software development tasks. Its capabilities go far beyond a simple chatbot.

#### **Core Architecture & Intelligence**

* **Agent-based Model (ReAct Framework):** The agent doesn't just generate text; it can **reason, plan, and take actions**. It operates in a "Thought -> Action -> Observation" loop to break down complex tasks into manageable steps.
* **Contextual Codebase Understanding (RAG):** It "learns" your specific codebase by converting it into a searchable knowledge base (using a **ChromaDB** vector store). This allows it to answer questions and write code that is contextually relevant to your project.
* **High-End Reasoning Engine:** It uses **Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro** model for its core logic, enabling sophisticated planning and code generation.

#### **Key Capabilities & Available Tools**

The agent has a comprehensive set of tools to interact with the development environment:

* **File System Management:**
    * `list_files`: To explore the project's directory structure.
    * `read_file`: To examine the content of existing files before making changes.
    * `write_file`: To create new files or save modifications to existing ones.
    * `delete_file`: To remove files during refactoring tasks.

* **Terminal Command Execution:**
    * `run_terminal_command`: A powerful tool to execute shell commands. This is primarily used for development tasks like:
        * Running test suites (e.g., `pytest`).
        * Installing dependencies (`pip install ...`).
        * Formatting code (`ruff format .`).

* **Intelligent Codebase Search:**
    * `search_codebase`: A special tool that leverages the RAG system, allowing the agent to perform semantic searches on your code to find examples, locate functions, or understand existing patterns.

#### **Safety & Control**

This is the most critical design feature of the agent.

* **Mandatory Human Approval (Human-in-the-Loop):** The agent **cannot perform any action automatically**. For every single proposed action (like writing a file or running a command), the system pauses and requires explicit `y/n` approval from you. This gives you complete control and prevents unintended consequences.

#### **Flexibility & Cost-Effectiveness**

* **Hybrid Model Strategy:** It uses the best tool for the job to manage costs.
    * **Reasoning:** Uses the powerful Gemini 1.5 Pro API.
    * **Embeddings:** You have the choice to either:
        1.  Use a **local, open-source model** (like `sentence-transformers`) for zero API cost.
        2.  Use **Google's Embedding API** for potentially higher accuracy.
        This choice is easily configurable.

#### **Production-Ready Design**

The agent is built with professional software engineering practices in mind:

* **Modular Code Structure:** The code is logically separated into configuration, tools, and agent execution logic, making it easy to maintain and extend.
* **Centralized Configuration:** All key parameters (model names, file paths) are managed in a single `config.py` file.
* **Detailed Logging:** All thoughts, actions, and outcomes are logged to a file (`agent.log`), which is essential for debugging and monitoring its behavior.
